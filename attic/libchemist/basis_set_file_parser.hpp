/** @brief This class abstracts away the layout of the basis set file and the
 *  mechanism by which it's parsed.
 *
 * Unfortunately there are a ton of different basis set file types.  At the
 * end of the day they all look something like:
 *
 * @verbatim
   Header (comments, and other information)
   Start of an Atom
   Shell 1
   Shell 2
   ...
   Start of Next Atom
   Shell 1
   Shell 2
   ...
   Footer
   @endverbatim
 *
 * Here's how this is going to work.  I'm going to loop over a file and give
 * you a line.  You're going to tell me if that line is worth parsing by
 * returning one of the action_type enums: none, same_atom, new_atom.
 * Respectively, these signal the line is not worth parsing, it is worth
 * parsing and the resulting data is for the current atom, it is worth parsing
 * but the data is for a new atom. (Note the first occurrence of parsable data
 * should be signaled by new_atom).
 *
 * For every parsable line you return an std::map<data_type,double> of the
 * data you obtained from the line.

 *
 *  I'm not sure that the Gaussian94 format is written down anywhere, but
 *  here's what I've managed to piece together:
 *
 *  - comment lines start with a !
 *  - atoms are separated by ****
 *  - after **** line appears the atomic symbol of the atom and a 0
 *    - I have no idea what the 0 is, but it seems to always be there
 *  - The remainder of the current atom block follows the form
 *    - Each shell starts with the letter code of the angular momentum
 *    followed by the number of primitives and then a 1.0
 *      - Again, not sure what the 1.0 is (normalization maybe?)
 *    - Next are n primitive lines of the form exponent coefficient
 *      - Two or more coefficients appear if the shell is a hybrid shell (sp)
